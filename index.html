        What I can tell you about Ryan is that he's reliable, hard working, and only bills for time he thinks produced value. Having worked with a lot of people, those qualities are gold to me. - Brennan Dunn: Founder, <a href="https://planscope.io/">Planscope</a>

        ryan joined a project whose team members had a range of experience. despite that disparity in experience, he had something to offer each of them: an adaptive, non-judgmental teaching style for noobs and a sounding board for the more experienced ones. during his contract he delivered solid, readable, and tested code, even with new-to-him frameworks. - Jerry Busser: Engineer, <a href="http://thinkcerca.com/">ThinkCERCA</a>
